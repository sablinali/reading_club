          Summary: "In this gut-wrenching blend of memoir and reportage, Rivera
          Garza investigates her younger sister Liliana’s 1990 murder by an
          abusive ex-boyfriend, who remains at large. Placing her sister’s death
          in the context of the femicide crisis in Mexico, Rivera Garza
          documents and recreates the years and months leading up to her murder,
          interweaving startling facts, case files and newspaper accounts with
          lyrical meditations on her family life and Liliana’s efforts to break
          away from her obsessive high school boyfriend. The excerpts from
          Liliana’s teenage diary and her oft-repeated desire not to be left
          alone haunt the narrative, as do Rivera Garza’s guilt and shame over
          her sister’s death."

          Recommendation: "This book gives us the insight and the language to
          identify the signs of danger and to see in plain sight how patriarchy
          deforms and hurts men, as much as it does women. Karen."

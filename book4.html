          Summary: "Did you know that trees can communicate with each other and
          have their own way to nurture each other? If not then this book is for
          you. Peter Wohlleben describes in his book how trees have a network of
          communication with each other and how they balance the ecosystem of
          the woods. This book changes your idea of the woods and their impact
          on our global ecosystem."

          Recommendation: "The book changed my view on trees and how important
          they are to humankind. Peter Wohlleben is a German forest ranger who
          does not only write from his own experiences but uses also sources.
          Also if this book is non-fiction, it is very interesting to read.
          Natascha."

          Summary: "At its center is Hayri Irdal, an infectiously charming
          antihero who becomes entangled with an eccentric cast of characters—a
          television mystic, a pharmacist who dabbles in alchemy, a dignitary
          from the lost Ottoman Empire, a “clock whisperer”—at the Time
          Regulation Institute, a vast organization that employs a hilariously
          intricate system of fines for the purpose of changing all the clocks
          in Turkiye to Western time. Recounted in sessions with his
          psychoanalyst, the story of Hayri Irdal’s absurdist misadventures
          plays out as a brilliant allegory of the collision of tradition and
          modernity, of East and West, infused with a poignant blend of hope for
          the promise of the future and nostalgia for a simpler time."

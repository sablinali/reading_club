          Summary: "Deep Rivers is a novel about an adolescent, Ernesto, in
          Peruvian Andean society in the 1920s. Apart from the pressures of
          growing up, Ernesto must come to terms with the antagonism between the
          dominant white society to which he belongs racially, and the Quechua
          society in which he was raised."

        <li>
          Recommendation: "You should read 'Deep Rivers' because it is a novel
          to learn and understand the roots of Peruvian culture, its Andean and
          indigenous identity and the evolution of its idiosincracy where
          unfortunately, violence and cruelty prevail. This unjust reality is
          also seen in other countries of our continent. Nevertheless, it has a
          great human value and beautiful descriptions of Peruvian geography.
          I'm sure you'll love it. Sablina."
